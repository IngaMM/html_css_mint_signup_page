Instructions

Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML & CSS.

This is a recreated version of the Mint's signup page (https://wwws.mint.com/login.event?task=S).
It does not include any of the dynamic functionality on the page but it is just made to look like the real page as much as possible.

Requirements
Browser
